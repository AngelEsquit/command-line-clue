## Notes
Detective's Initial Report:

I overheard The Shopkeeper mentioning something strange they noticed near the library.


New Clue:

Check the dock in the park.

Hint: You'll need to go back several directories to reach this location.
Remember that you can use multiple '../' to go up multiple levels:
- 'cd ..'    goes up one level
- 'cd ../..' goes up two levels
- and so on...


New Clue:

Check the classrooms in the school.

Hint: You'll need to go back several directories to reach this location.
Remember that you can use multiple '../' to go up multiple levels:
- 'cd ..'    goes up one level
- 'cd ../..' goes up two levels
- and so on...


New Clue:

Something tells me we should go back and check somewhere else in the town hall.

Hint: You'll need to go back several directories to reach this location.
Remember that you can use multiple '../' to go up multiple levels:
- 'cd ..'    goes up one level
- 'cd ../..' goes up two levels
- and so on...


Investigation Update:

Through the window, you spot movement in the direction of the offices.

Remember: Use 'cd "offices"' to follow this lead.


Investigation Conclusion:

The undisturbed dust patterns confirm it - you've found the crime scene! The emptiness of the room speaks volumes.

Your careful detective work has paid off. The empty state of this room matches 
witness accounts - no one was around when the crime occurred. This must be 
where the murderer carried out their plan!

Make sure to document this discovery in your notebook.md file along with your 
other findings about the weapon and suspect.


*Use this space to record your findings and deductions...*

Location of the crime is still unknown - the room must have been empty when it happened...
